# Enigma Machine Encryption Project

This project aims to emulate the famous Enigma machine encryption method used during World War II. It will allow users to encrypt and decrypt their messages using the same (or closest as possible) algorithm as the original Enigma machine.

## Features and ideas

1. Emulate the original Enigma machine encryption method.
2. Allow users to input their own settings, such as rotor positions and plugboard configurations.
3. Option to save encrypted messages in a file.
4. Future plans to use `tkinter` for GUI.
5. Future plans to create a web interface for easy use of the algorithm.
